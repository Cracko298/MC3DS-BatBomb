## Download:
- **Their is currently no direct download, however... you can install this mod via the Minecraft 3DS Unistore [Here](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/minecraft-3ds-unistore).**

## Notes:
- This mod gives Bat's in Minecraft 3DS Edition the ability to chase down the player or other hostile mods if spotted.
- They're very fast and agile, but do very little damage, just a supprise really and a fun loop for mining in the depths of the Game.
